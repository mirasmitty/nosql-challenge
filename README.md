# Background
The UK Food Standards Agency evaluates various establishments across the United Kingdom, and gives them a food hygiene rating. You've been contracted by the editors of a food magazine, Eat Safe, Love, to evaluate some of the ratings data in order to help their journalists and food critics decide where to focus future articles.

# Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `Reources`: Folder containing data file.
  - `establishments.json`: JSON data file used for analysis.
- `NoSQL_setup_starter.ipynb`: Starter file for set-up code (Parts 1 and 2).
- `NoSQL_analysis_starter.ipynb`: File cotaining code for analysis (Part 3).
